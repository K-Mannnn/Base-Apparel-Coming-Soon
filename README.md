## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first front end project and it's been a good experience to test my CSS and markdown knowledge and learn new things along the way, such as use of different CSS units etc. and this project has helped me better understand CSS felxbox and its limitations. 

In addition, it was good to practice raw javascipt for form validation on a single field and writing my own function from scratch without any tutorial help.  

### Continued development

So far I have not used CSS grid in any of my learning projects and looking at other solutions for this project, I would like to get practising with the grid.
